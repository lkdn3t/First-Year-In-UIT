2.1	Build a data structure to store a very large Integer (bigInt)
-	A BigInt is an Integer that has a large number of digits ( > 20 digits)
-	Hints: Use link-list to store BigInt’s digits.
2.2	Operation of BigInt:
2.2.1	Read a BigInt from file:
-	The Input text file consists of only single line containing BigInt.
-	Read the input text file and store the BigInt into a Link List
2.2.2	Write a BigInt to file:
-	The Input text file consists of only single line containing BitInt.
-	Write the BigInt to file.
2.2.3	Write the function to calculate addition, subtraction and multiplication of two Big integers
The program must be: StudentID.exe__filename1.txt__filename2.txt__X
In which:
-	StudentID.exe : name of your program
-	Filename1.txt: input text file for BigInt 1.
-	Filename2.txt: input text file for BigInt 2.
-	X = “+” or “-” or “*” : the operator for two BigInt.
-	The BigInt result will be stored in file which is naming as StudentID.txt
